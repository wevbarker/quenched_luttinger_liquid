<<A highly minimalistic, commented version of the TDHFT program is included with this report. Most of the features used for measuring the properties of the system (such as the position of the compression front) have been removed for brevity. There are three ".cpp" source files which may be compiled to produce corresponding ".exe" files. When compiling, it is necessary to link to the GSL installation. The parameters of the simulations must be changed within the source files themselves. Physical parameters are the basis dimension, $d$, electron number, $N$, shunt parameter, $q$, quasi-one-dimensionality parameter, $\xi$ and a coupling constant proportional to $e^2$. It is further possible to change the resolution of the FFT, the number of iterations for both ground state convergence and time evolution, and the time step. The first program, "kernel.exe", performs the FFT on the pair potential, storing the result in the file "kernel.dat" in the home directory. Next, "integrator.exe" forms libraries of the matrices $\mathsf{\Lambda}_{jk}$ and $\mathsf{\Pi}_{jk}$ respectively in the files "hartree.dat" and "exchange.dat". The addresses, $j$, $k$ of the matrices within these files are stored separately in "Ha_lookup.dat" and "Ex_lookup.dat". Finally "simulator.exe" performs the simulation, printing the $n$th iteration in the sub-directory "/frames/" as "frame_n.png". The current simulation method involves piping to Gnuplot. It is vital that "simulator.cpp" be initialized before compiling so that the path to "gnuplot.exe" is specified in the file: if the program cannot call Gnuplot it will be unable to output data.>>
